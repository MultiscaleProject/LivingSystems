# Boolean Networks

Boolean networks are a type of mathematical model used to study the dynamics of complex systems. They use binary variables (0 or 1) to represent states, and Boolean logic to define their interactions. This makes them ideal for studying biological pathways, as they can be used to model interactions between genes and proteins, as well as many other kinds of interactions. By simulating these networks, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how complex systems work.

State transition diagrams are used to represent the dynamics of a system. They are graphical representations of the states that a system can be in and the transitions that can occur between them. The diagrams are typically used to model the behavior of a system over time.
