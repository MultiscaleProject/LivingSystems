# LivingSystems
## Mathematical models for living systems

The following codes have been created as part of a research project that seeks to understand the role of multiscale structures and dynamics in the self-organizing complexity of active matter and living systems. We will use evolutionary models of Boolean and adaptive networks to explore the origins and consequences of multiscale modularity in biological networks

## Boolean Networks

A Boolean Network is a model that shows how different components in a system interact with each other. It only uses two values, true or false, and each component is represented by a node. The connections between components are shown as edges.

Boolean Networks are helpful in understanding how living systems work and how they can be changed to achieve specific goals.
